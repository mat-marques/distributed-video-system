\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Callback prototype for audio playback.
The LibVLC media player decodes and post-processes the audio signal
asynchronously (in an internal thread). Whenever audio samples are ready
to be queued to the output, this callback is invoked.
The number of samples provided per invocation may depend on the file format,
the audio coding algorithm, the decoder plug-in, the post-processing
filters and timing. Application must not assume a certain number of samples.
The exact format of audio samples is determined by L{libvlc_audio_set_format}()
or L{libvlc_audio_set_format_callbacks}() as is the channels layout.
Note that the number of samples is per channel. For instance, if the audio
track sampling rate is 48000 Hz, then 1200 samples represent 25 milliseconds
of audio signal - regardless of the number of audio channels.
@param data: data pointer as passed to L{libvlc_audio_set_callbacks}() [IN].
@param samples: pointer to a table of audio samples to play back [IN].
@param count: number of audio samples to play back.
@param pts: expected play time stamp (see libvlc_delay()).
